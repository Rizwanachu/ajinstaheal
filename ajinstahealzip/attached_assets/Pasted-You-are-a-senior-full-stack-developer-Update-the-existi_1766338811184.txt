You are a senior full-stack developer.

Update the existing appointment booking web app that uses Google Calendar as the backend.

DO NOT rebuild from scratch.
Modify and extend the current system only.

--------------------------------
DOCTOR DASHBOARD (AVAILABILITY CONTROL)
--------------------------------

Create a secure Doctor Dashboard with access limited to the doctor only.

Features required:

1. BLOCK FULL DAYS (LEAVE)
- Doctor can select a specific date
- Mark the entire day as unavailable (leave)
- System creates an all-day "blocked" event in Google Calendar
- That date must NOT appear as bookable to patients

2. BLOCK SPECIFIC TIME RANGES
- Doctor can select:
  - Date
  - Start time
  - End time
- Mark that time range as unavailable
- Create a blocking event in Google Calendar
- Patients must NOT see or select those time slots

3. REAL-TIME EFFECT
- Availability shown to patients must immediately reflect:
  - Leaves
  - Blocked times
  - Existing bookings
- All availability logic must be derived from Google Calendar only

--------------------------------
BOOKING AVAILABILITY RULES
--------------------------------

- Patient booking UI must:
  - Hide blocked dates completely
  - Hide blocked time slots
  - Prevent selection via backend validation as well
- No hardcoded unavailable dates or times

--------------------------------
EMAIL CONTENT FIX (IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------

Remove sentence like below COMPLETELY from ALL outgoing emails: 
"If you have any questions, please contact us at contact@ajinstaheal.com" "Questions? Contact us at contact@ajinstaheal.com" 

This includes:
- Booking confirmation emails
- Reschedule confirmation emails
- Cancellation emails
- Reminder emails

Do not include any fallback contact email text.

--------------------------------
SECURITY & ACCESS
--------------------------------

- Doctor dashboard must NOT be publicly accessible
- Protect it using:
  - A simple password stored in environment variables
  - OR a secret access key
- Do NOT use paid authentication services
- Do NOT expose credentials on the client

--------------------------------
CODE REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------

- Use existing Google Calendar integration
- Use Google Calendar events as the single source of truth
- Use clear event naming (e.g. "BLOCKED – Leave" or "BLOCKED – Unavailable")
- Clean, readable, commented code
- No breaking changes to patient booking flow

--------------------------------
EXPECTED RESULT
--------------------------------

- Doctor can manage availability (days & times)
- Patients cannot book blocked dates or times
- Emails are clean and professional without unwanted text
- System remains fully free and deployable on Vercel

Implement all changes directly.
Do not ask questions.
